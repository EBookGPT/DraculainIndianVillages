# The Tale of Dracula in India's Comics and Graphic Novels

In the land of India, a great evil had made its way into the heart of the people. Dracula, the infamous vampire lord, had arrived in the country with his minions, spreading darkness and destruction wherever he went. His goal was to find an ancient artifact that would grant him immense power, allowing him to rule over the world with an iron fist.

The great cities and towns of India were quickly taken over by Dracula's demon minions. The people lived in fear and dread, praying for a savior to come and save them from the vampire's clutches.

Ravi quickly realized that this was his chance to make a difference. He picked up the comic book, and as he began to read it, he felt a surge of power coursing through his veins. Suddenly, he transformed into the hero from the comic book and found himself equipped with a crossbow and a stake.

Ravi set out on a mission to vanquish Dracula and his minions, using his new powers to fight his way through the streets of India. He encountered a variety of characters from Indian mythology and folklore along the way, including the Hindu god Hanuman and the demon Ravana from the Ramayana epic.
